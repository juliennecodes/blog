I budgeted the first week for planning and writing the barebones app. After the first week was over, I was surprised at how much got done. I didn’t have high expectations of a barebones app but after implementing the CRUD operations, I found that the app had a lot of functionality.</p>\n<p>By the end of the first week, I was able to create, read, and delete both images and annotations.\nI learned about CRUD operations in the bootcamp I was recently enrolled in.* I hadn’t thought about CRUD applications as the <a href=\"https://juliennecodes.github.io/blog/start-with-something-simple\">something simple</a> that I can build apps around but I certainly will in the future.</p>\n<sub> \n*Technically not true.

I didn’t have enough context to really understand the concept then but I can see why she told me about it now.\n</sub>","frontmatter":{"title":"CRUD App as Barebones App","date":"July 05, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/polish-or-feature-rich/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Decisions Decisions.
