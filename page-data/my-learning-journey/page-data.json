I was reading a lot of books, watching online course videos, and experimenting with writing websites. Looking back on it, the things I made were very simple and if I did them now, I would need just a fraction of the time I spent on it. However, at the  time, I had absolutely no programming experience and I was diving headfirst into making things while simultaneously being introduced to the concepts. I was doing simple work but it was a necessary beginning. It gave me the context I needed when I started a more structured learning of JavaScript.</p>\n<p>At the behest of my mentors, I started reading Eloquent JavaScript. I had assigned chapters to read every week. There were also exercises at the end of each chapter to test the concepts learned. I met with my mentors every Sunday so I could ask them questions, of which there were plenty. I got my code reviewed and received  a lot of advice on how I should write moving forward, which I took. Week by week, I continually grew as a software developer. By the end, I learned the fundamentals of JavaScript and progressed to learning React, a UI JavaScript library.</p>\n<p>React was suggested to me as the next step. For practical reasons, React was a popular JavaScript library that a lot of companies use. For personal reasons, my educational background is in the visual arts so I was naturally more inclined towards the frontend side of programming.</p>\n<p>It was at this point that I shifted towards a more project-based learning. I started writing apps with the goal of learning something new in each one. I’ve undertaken progressively more challenging projects than the one that came before. In the process, I learned about states, React hooks, React Router, automated testing, client-server communication among many others.</p>\n<p>In the process of writing apps, I’ve been introduced to the backend territory of programming. I started with Express, writing REST APIs. More recently, I enrolled in <a href=\"https://allaboardbootcamp.com/\">All Aboard Bootcamp</a>, which taught me Ruby on Rails. I had familiarity with the concept of endpoints through past projects and expanded on my backend knowledge by learning to work with databases(through Rails).</p>\n<p>There is still so much to learn. My programming journey is ongoing as I continue to move towards the backend territory of software development. Particularly I think GraphQL, and databases.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"My Learning Journey","date":"July 01, 2021","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/use-an-older-commit-as-head/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Blog Template Title"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/start-with-something-simple/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Start With Something Simple"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"349b53c0-3a69-5b43-9a96-04f67bbb1eb3","previousPostId":"0b9594f3-0470-5fdc-bc14-d2a694d13e5c","nextPostId":"5678a007-2d27-566b-926f-a4ac8cf001ee"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383"]}
