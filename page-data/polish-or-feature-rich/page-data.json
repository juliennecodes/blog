For the first week, I outlined my three-week plan and set up a CRUD application that served as the foundation of the app. I implemented the key part of my app, Direct-to-Image Annotation, just before the second week ended.</p>\n<p>By my original schedule, I was supposed to add a Users feature. This addition involved updating my database to include a Users table. I would also need to introduce new associations such as a User having many Images and Annotations. Image would belong to a User. Annotation would belong to a User in addition to its current association of belonging to an Image. However, when I assessed where my app was at the time, I found it hard to use.</p>\n<p>The app was working, it just wasn’t pleasant to use. The positions of the buttons were all over the place and the grouping of controls could improve a lot. With so many things to improve on, I was at a crossroads for what I want to do for the final week. It was either spend the final week polishing the app or adding a new feature. I had limited time so I couldn’t do both.</p>\n<p>I asked my Project Manager (Bootcamp Instructor acting as one) what he was looking for in the final project. Did he prefer a polished app with less features or a feature-rich app that isn’t as pleasant to use? I presented my choices and he left it up to me as he was alright with either direction.</p>\n<p>In the end, I chose to polish the app. After finishing the project, I think this was the right decision. I chose to have a polished product over a feature-rich product because at the end of the day, I thought it was more important that the product does its job well.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Decisions Decisions.
