One of the factors in me making Pomodoro was because I use pomodoro timers. Me being a user shaped the app I built as a lot of the decisions I made regarding Pomodoro was centred around what I, as a user, would want the app to be.

One of the features I wanted was a gentle sound to indicate that the session was over. One of my experiences from other pomodoro timers was a really loud bell sound after the session was over. Yes, it did the job of indicating that the session was over. However, it made for a really jarring experience when I was really absorbed in a task and got taken out of that state by a loud ringing sound. So when I wrote Pomodoro, I made sure to find the right sound. In terms of user experience, the previous pomodoro timer was like a violent shake to the shoulder, whereas, I opted for a kind of gentle tap to indicate that the session is over.

I also wanted to limit the need for user input. As a user, all I want to do is press the start button to start the timer. I don’t want to have to keep track of whether I am supposed to be working, taking a break, or taking a big break. So, I did just that. The app is programmed to follow a pattern of work then break sessions, and if the user has completed four work sessions, switch to a big break session. The user is not aware of the mechanisms involved, nor should they be. I wanted to write an app that is easy for the user to use and still deliver results.

I also kept the user in mind when designing the UI. The primary information such as the number of pomodoros completed, the remaining time, and the timer button are front and center. Secondary information such as the button for completing the day are off to the side corner, taking up less space. It is still there, it just doesn’t command the same attention as the main part of the timer. By placement, size, and colour, I kept the primary part of Pomodoro prominent and the secondary part less so, presenting information in a clear manner.

By constantly keeping in mind what features I, as a user, wanted, I was able to improve the app and hold it to a higher standard. I think the line of thinking of developing around the user is a good one to carry as it is a reminder that the app is a product for the user and user experience is of utmost importance.
